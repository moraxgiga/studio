# **App Name**: SynapseAI

## Core Features:

- Animated Intro: Animated intro sequence simulating a neural network initializing. Displays a network of nodes connecting and data streams initializing, establishing the AI theme.
- Interactive Skills Display: Interactive "Skills" section displaying the AI engineer's skills as dynamically updating data points or nodes in a network. Visualize proficiency using glowing intensity or node size.
- Project Visualizations: Project showcases with interactive demos or data visualizations. Use animated charts, graphs, or 3D models to illustrate project outcomes and data flows.
- Chatbot Interface: A 'Contact' section using a chatbot-style interface or command-line terminal for direct interaction. Users can type commands or questions to interact.
- AI Blog Suggestions: AI-powered content suggestion tool for the blog section. The tool suggests related articles based on the user's browsing history.

## Style Guidelines:

- Dark mode default to enhance the futuristic feel.
- Neon blue (#0ff), purple (#f0f), or green (#0f0) highlights to accent interactive elements and key information.
- Accent color: Electric Indigo (#6F00FF) for a striking and modern look.
- Futuristic sans-serif or monospaced fonts to emulate a coder/AI terminal aesthetic.
- Use abstract icons or geometric patterns inspired by circuit diagrams and neural networks.
- Smooth transitions and subtle parallax effects to create depth and engagement.
- Micro-interactions on hover, such as nodes lighting up or data streams animating, to provide feedback and enhance the interactive experience.
- Grid-based or asymmetrical layouts that evoke a sense of organized complexity.

## Original User Request:
Design and build an animated portfolio website specifically tailored for an AI engineer. The overall aesthetic should embody the essence of artificial intelligenceâ€”futuristic, sleek, and intelligent in appearance. The design should feel like it was created by an AI, for an AI. Think dynamic neural network visuals, data streams, glowing nodes, geometric patterns, or abstract circuit-like elements as part of the UI.

Design requirements:

Animated intro that mimics a neural network coming online or data initializing.

Sections: About Me, Skills, Projects (with interactive demos or visuals), Publications, Blog, Contact.

Interactivity: Smooth transitions, hover effects, subtle parallax, AI-inspired micro-interactions (like hovering over a brain node and seeing it activate).

Color palette: Dark mode default with neon blues, purples, or green highlights.

Typography: Futuristic sans-serif fonts or monospaced fonts for that coder/AI terminal vibe.

Tech stack suggestion: React or Next.js with Framer Motion for animations, Tailwind CSS for styling.

Optional: Include a chatbot-style interface or command-line terminal for navigating parts of the site.
